/* Small documentation for the library:
   Your program might get a list of available arrays with the two functions
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
     SPS_GetNextSpec (flag) 
     SPS_GetNextArray (specversion, flag)
     
     Just call the function SPS_GetNextSpec until a NULL pointer is returned.
     The first time you call the function you have to set the flag to 0 to
     indicate it should start from the beginning. For every spec version call
     the function SPS_GetNextArray to get all the shared memory arrays from
     this spec version. 

     Example: 
         for (i=0; spec_version = SPS_GetNextSpec (i) ; i++)
            for (j=0; array = SPS_GetNextArray (spec_version, j) ; j++)
              printf("%s %s\n",spec_version, array);


   Your program can know in which state a certain spec version is in
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
     SPS_GetSpecState (version)
     
     The exact meaning of this flag will be documented

   Your program can get the data from the shared memory array with
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
      SPS_GetDataCopy (spec version, array, data format, &rows, &cols)
      
   You can get a copy of the array data in the format you want. Possible 
   choices for the format are: SPS_DOUBLE SPS_FLOAT SPS_INT SPS_UINT
   SPS_SHORT SPS_USHORT SPS_CHAR SPS_UCHAR where DOUBLE and FLOAT are 
   foating point numbers and the other integer values. The U is a short
   cut for unsigned. INT is stored in 4 byte, SHORT in 2 byte and CHAR in
   on byte. 
   Only one private buffer per shared memory array is possible with this
   function. This buffer is reused at the next call to SPS_GetDataCopy.
   The buffer can be given back with the function

      SPS_FreeDataCopy (spec version, array name)

   but as there is only one per spec version this is rarely necessary. 

      SPS_GetDataRow (version, array, data format, row, columns, &actual cols)
      SPS_GetDataCol (version, array, data format, col, rows, &actual rows)

   Will only give you one row or one column. This functions will use the
   same buffer as SPS_GetDataCopy. The buffer can be freed with 
   SPS_FreeDataCopy but it is reused anyhow. 
   
   To know if the values in your buffer still correspond to the data in
   the shared memory array, there is the function

      SPS_IsUpdated (spec version, array name)

   This function will return the integer value 1 if it is necessary to 
   call SPS_GetDataCopy again. The function SPS_IsUpdated will tell you
   if the shared memory array has been updated since the last time you
   called this function. A return value of -1 indicated that this shared 
   memory array is currently not accessible. To get this information,
   the function has to call the external program ipcs. It is therefore 
   rather slow. Please lower the rate at which you call SPS_IsUpdated
   in this case.


   Example:
      for (;;) {
        if (SPS_IsUpdated ("spec","a_test") == 1) {
          printf("Changed:\n");
          dbuf = SPS_GetDataCopy ("spec","a_test", SPS_DOUBLE, &rows, &cols);
          for (k_row = 0; k_row < rows; k_row ++) {
            for (k_col = 0; k_col < cols < 7; k_col ++)
              printf ("%10.10g ",*(double_buf + k_row * cols + k_col));
            printf("\n");
          }
        }
        sleep(1);
      }

      SPS_IsUpdated (spec version, array name)

   This function is an alternative form of the above. It returns the 
   current update counter for this array or -1 if not longer updated. It
   is used in some cases where the simpler function SPS_IsUpdated is not 
   sufficient (For example if you have multiple subroutines in your program 
   which access the shared memory independently. The SPS routines can not 
   distinguish between calls from the same subroutine twice or single calls 
   from different subroutines)
   You should keep the old counter value and compare the returned value to
   the old. If it is changed you have to update your array.


   Functions to read shared memory string arrays for resources
   -----------------------------------------------------------

   The shared memory string array must be organized in the format:
      identifier=value 
   in a single row of a two dimensional array for these functions to work.

      SPS_GetEnvStr (spec_version, array, identifier)

   returns the value of this identifier or NULL if not found. The function

      SPS_PutEnvStr (spec_version, array, identifier, value)

   puts a value in a row of a 2 dimensional shared memory string array. If
   the identifier was already present before, its value will be updated. 

   Example:
       46.SPEC> shared string array text[10][100] #10 strings of max length 100
       47.SPEC> p text
          xaxis=hello you
          yaxis=Counts
          new=23.45

       SPS_GetEnvStr("spec", "text", "xaxis") returns "hello you"

   More functions to read data from the shared memory
   -------------------------------------------------  

      SPS_GetArrayInfo (spec version, array, &rows, &cols, &type, &flag)

   informs you about the properties of the shared memory array.

      SPS_GetDataPointer (spec version, array name, write_flag)
 
   returns a pointer to the data in the shared memory array. Do not keep
   this pointer around. The memory might have been deleted and recreated 
   and this pointer will not point anymore to the right data. We recommand
   to call the SPS_GetPointer function before each operation on the
   shared memory. The write_flag tells the function if you would like
   to update the shared memory contents or just read it.

   If you want to make a copy of the data in the shared memory array to
   your own buffer or the copy your buffer to the shared memory you can use 
   the functions: 

      SPS_CopyFromShared (spec version, array name, 
                     &buffer, data format, items_in_buffer);
      SPS_CopyToShared (spec version, array name, 
                     &buffer, data format, items_in_buffer);
      SPS_CopyRowFromShared (spec version, array name, &buffer, data_format, 
               row to copy, no of columns to copy, &actual columns copied)
      SPS_CopyColFromShared (spec version, array name, &buffer, data_format, 
               column to copy, no of rows to copy, &actual rows copied)
      SPS_CopyRowToShared (spec version, array name, &buffer, data_format, 
               row to copy, no of columns to copy, &actual columns copied)
      SPS_CopyColToShared (spec version, array name, &buffer, data_format, 
               column to copy, no of rows to copy, &actual rows copied)

   These functions are a little bit different from
   the SPS_GetDataCopy function in that you will have to manage your buffer
   yourself. (Allocate the memory, free the memory, ...)

      SPS_AttachToArray (spec version, array_name, write_flag)
     
   can be called anytime. It will try to attach to the shared memory. If it
   fails to attach to the memory it will still remember the fact that you want
   to stay attached to the shared memory and will attach you the next time 
   you call one of the SPS_ functions for this spec version and array. The
   write_flag has to be set to 1 if you want to write to this array in
   the future. 

      SPS_DetachFromArray (spec version, array name)

   Detaches from the array or informs the library that we don't want to 
   stay attached to the array. 
   If you write to the shared memory you have to tell all the processes
   which are reading he shared memory that the contents has changed. To do
   that you can call
 
     SPS_UpdateDone (spec version, array name)


   If you need to know the number of bytes for a certain type call:

     SPS_Size (type)

   Creating your own shared memory arrays with
   -------------------------------------------

      SPS_CreateArray (spec version, array name,rows,cols, data format, flags)
   
   This function creates shared memory arrays like SPEC would do that. For
   every spec version there is a shared memory array which holds information
   about this spec version. This function will create this information
   array together with the actual data array. If you want to create 
   multiple arrays it is much more efficient to use always the same 
   name for the spec version. You can not create a shared memory array for
   a spec version which already exists and has not been created by your 
   process. 

     SPS_CleanUpAll()
   
   is used to delete all the shared memory you created and free all the 
   memory the libray allocated. Do not use any buffer pointer you got
   from the library from then onwards. You can continue to run and use
   the SPS_ functions again, but in most cases this incstruction will be 
   called just before quiting the program.
