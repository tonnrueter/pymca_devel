/*
  High level function to transform data of a certain type (SPS_FLOAT,
  SPS_DOUBLE, SPS_INT, SPS_UINT, SPS_SHORT, SPS_USHORT, SPS_CHAR, SPS_UCHAR)
  into a representation suitable for display on a screen. 

  The size of the input array is given in cols and rows. 

  The data array can be reduced by a factor reduc. The number of output
  pixel in each direction will be divided by this factor. The values
  prows and pcols tell the size of this new array in pixel. The flag fastreduc
  can be set to do a faster reduction by not doing an average of the
  pixel to be reduced but skipping the pixels.

  The meth can be set to SPS_LINEAR, SPS_LOG or SPS_GAMMA to define in with
  way the data is mapped to the colors. The following formulas are used:

   SPS_LINEAR:   mapdata = A * data + B
   SPS_LOG   :   mapdata = (A * log(data)) + B
   SPS_GAMMA :   mapdata = A * pow(data, gamma) + B

  The autoscale flag has to be set to know if the minimum and maximum
  data values should be found automatically or if they are given in 
  min, max. If autoscale is used the resulting minimum and maximum values
  are returned in min and max. If the method is not SPS_LINEAR, the routine
  will not return the smallest data value but the smallest positive data
  values. 
    ! Check for SPS_SHORT SPS_USHORT SPS_CHAR SPS_UCHAR behaviour !

  The values of mapmin and mapmax matter mainly when a hardware palette 
  is used. Both values have to be in [0,255]. You can decide the minimum 
  and maximum output value in this case. If you specify for example mapmin=100
  and mapmax=250 you can leave colors for the window manager. If you would
  like to use your private colormap you could use mapmin=0 mapmax=250. In this
  example we leave 5 colors for other elements in our application starting
  from index 251 to 255. 

  The mapbytes value tell the routine the depth of the display you will use.
  The distribution of colors in this bytes is assumed to be fixed. You
  can have the following cases:
      0 : Hardware palette. The colors are given by the hardware. Only a
          value between mapmin and mapmax is produced.
      2 : The RGB parts of the 16 bits are supposed to be 5 bits per color.
          The remaining bit is set to 0.
      3 : The RGB parts of the 24 bits are supposed to be 8 bits per color.
      4 : The RGB parts of the 32 bits are supposed to be 8 bits per color.
          The remaining 8 bits are set to 0.

   The additional parameter maptype is given to distinguish different 
   distributions of the colorbits:
      SPS_NORMAL: Standard distribution (i.e. for 16 bits (5/5/5) for (R/G/B)
      SPS_16BIT : Special case for 16 bit depth (normally 15 bits)
                  distribution is (5/5/6) for (R/G/B)
   The additional parameter maporder represent the byte order of the X server
   used. it can be either :
      SPS_LSB : low byte first
      SPS_MSB : high byte first

   The palette code describes the colors of the palette and is only used if
   we do not use a hardware palette.
      SPS_GREYSCALE : Gradient from white to black. There are 32 different
            colors possible on a 2 byte display and 256 on an 4 byte display.
      SPS_TEMP : A color range from red to blue. There are 128 different 
            colors possible on a 2 byte display and 1024 on a 4 byte display.

   The palette is returned in palette. The palette is either 2 or 4 bytes
   deep and has pal_entries number of entries. This can be used to present
   a color bar to the user. To be able to asign data numbers to every entry
   in the color table you have to understand the different palette modes.
   They are to some extend explained in the documentation for SPS_MapData 
   The palette data must not be freed!!!!
   
   The return values points to an array of 1, 2, or 4 byte pixels of the
   size prows pcols. The data should be freed when not longer in use.
   A return value of NULL indicates an error.

   SPS_LOG   :   mapdata = (A * log(data)) + B
   SPS_GAMMA :   mapdata = A * pow(data, gamma) + B

   mapbytes indicates the depth of the palette or is zero if a hardware
   palette is used. It can take the following values:

       0 : Xmin will be maped to mapmin and Xmax to mapmax.
           mapmin and mapmax have to bin in [0,255]. This mode is thought to
	   be used with hardware plalettes and the parameter pal is ignored.
       2 : The color table is 2 bytes deep. In this case, for every color 
           there are 5 bits and the last bit is ignored. The mapping is 
	   different depending on the type of the input data.
	   
           SPS_INT, SPS_UINT, SPS_DOUBLE, SPS_FLOAT : The mapping is done
	   according to the above formula. The color palette is supposed
	   to contain the coresponding RGB values for each of the values 
	   between mapmin and mapmax.

	   SPS_USHORT SPS_SHORT SPS_CHAR SPS_UCHAR : No mapping is done !!!
           The actual data values are used direcly as index in the color
	   table.

   3 or 4: The color table is 4 byte deep. There are 3 times 8 bit for
           RGB and 8 bit are ignored. The mapping is described above.
   
   Maybe a less confusing way how these parameters are interpreted is to
   think of the mapping and indexing process as sequential processes.
   In general the source data is first mapped to a range of values which
   are used as indexes in a table of colors.
   When there is a hardware palette (mode mapbytes = 0) then this routine
   has to produce values between 0 and 255. There values can be further
   restricted with mapmin and mapmax to allow other colors to stay in same
   color table. This can be used to give the window manager enough colors
   to operate without creating a private colormap. A standard setting is
   mapmin = 100 mapmax = 250.

   When there is no hardware palette, a palette has to be provided to the
   routine. Every entry of this palette is either 2bytes or 4bytes deep
   depending on the screen color depth. 
   Because of performance reasons we do not want to map data first to 
   other values and use these calculated values as an index into the
   palette if we can use the data directly as an index in the color 
   table. Therefore there is a distinction between types which contain
   data with many different values (SPS_INT SPS_UINT SPS_FLOAT SPS_DOUBLE)
   and data with a restricted number of different values (SPS_SHORT SPS_USHORT
   SPS_CHAR SPS_UCHAR). This distinction complicates of course the calculation
   of the palette which has to be provided. 
   
   The palette in the case of input types with restricted values must take 
   into account scaling and the different ways of mapping (linear, log, gamma)
   as there is no other mapping taken place. The routine SPS_PaletteArray does
   take all this into acount and should be used in almost all cases.
